# Sample Project

This is a sample Python project created for testing the CodeSage MCP tools.

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Main application logic and entry point.
- `data_processing.py`: Functions for reading, cleaning, and transforming data.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions and classes.
- `web_api.py`: Placeholder for web API functionality (not implemented).
- `config.json`: Configuration file.
- `data/input.csv`: Sample input data.

## Features for CodeSage Testing

- **TODOs/FIXMEs**: Several TODO and FIXME comments are scattered throughout the code.
- **Undocumented Functions**: Some functions lack docstrings.
- **Duplicated Code**: Intentional duplication in `data_processing.py` to test duplicate detection.
- **Dependencies**: Uses standard libraries like `csv`, `json`, `logging`, `os`, `sys`, `typing`.
- **Complexity**: Varying levels of function complexity.

This project is designed to be a good candidate for a comprehensive analysis using the CodeSage tools.
