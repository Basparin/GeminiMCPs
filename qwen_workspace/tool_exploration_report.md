# CodeSage Tool Exploration Report

This report documents the exploration and usage of CodeSage MCP tools on the sample project.

## 1. Project Setup and Indexing

The sample project was created and successfully indexed using `index_codebase_tool`.

```python
result = index_codebase_tool('qwen_workspace/sample_project')
print(result)
# Output:
# {
#   'message': 'Codebase at qwen_workspace/sample_project indexed successfully.',
#   'indexed_files_count': 9,
#   'indexed_files': [
#     'web_api.py', 'utils.py', 'data_processing.py', 'data_processing.py',
#     '__init__.py', 'README.md', 'config.json', 'data/__init__.py', 'data/input.csv'
#   ]
# }
```

**Note:** There were warnings about syntax errors in some Python files, likely due to docstring parsing issues. This didn't prevent indexing.

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1 Overall Improvements Analysis

Using `analyze_codebase_improvements_tool` provided a comprehensive overview:

```python
result = analyze_codebase_improvements_tool('qwen_workspace/sample_project')
# Key findings from 'analysis' key:
# - total_files: 9
# - python_files: 6
# - todo_comments: 10
# - fixme_comments: 5
# - undocumented_functions: 0
# - Suggestions:
#   - Address 10 TODO comments
#   - Fix 5 FIXME issues
#   - Use other specific tools for deeper analysis
```

This gives a good high-level summary of areas needing attention.

### 2.2 Undocumented Functions Check

Attempted to use `list_undocumented_functions_tool`:

```python
# On data_processing.py (which has docstrings)
result = list_undocumented_functions_tool('qwen_workspace/sample_project/data_processing.py')
# Output: {'message': 'No undocumented functions found...'}

# On web_api.py (which has docstrings but caused an error)
result = list_undocumented_functions_tool('qwen_workspace/sample_project/web_api.py')
# Error: SyntaxError and NameError (HTTPException not defined)
```

**Insight:** The `list_undocumented_functions_tool` seems to work correctly when the file is parseable, but has a bug where it references `HTTPException` without importing it. This is a clear area for improvement in the tool itself.

### 2.3 Duplicate Code Detection

The `find_duplicate_code_tool` successfully identified duplicated sections:

```python
result = find_duplicate_code_tool('qwen_workspace/sample_project')
# Output: Found 6 duplicate code sections.
# Example duplicate:
# {
#   "file1": "qwen_workspace/sample_project/data_processing.py",
#   "file2": "/home/basparin/Escritorio/GeminiMCPs/qwen_workspace/sample_project/data_processing.py",
#   "start_line1": 108, # Start of first `process_data` function
#   "end_line1": 127,
#   "start_line2": 132, # Start of second `process_data` function
#   "end_line2": 151,
#   "similarity": 0.999...
# }
```

**Insight:** The tool correctly identified the intentionally duplicated function in `data_processing.py` with a very high similarity score (~0.999). It also flagged other sections, which might be false positives or less critical duplicates, showing the tool's sensitivity.

### 2.4 Dependency Analysis

The `get_dependencies_overview_tool` provided a clear breakdown:

```python
result = get_dependencies_overview_tool('qwen_workspace/sample_project')
# Key findings:
# - total_python_files_analyzed: 1 (seems low, might be a bug or limitation)
# - unique_stdlib_modules: ['csv', 'logging', 'typing']
# - total_third_party_dependencies: 0
# - stdlib_dependencies_by_file: Shows which stdlib modules each file uses
```

**Insight:** This tool gives a good overview of dependencies. The count of analyzed files seems off, which might be a point to investigate.

## 3. Semantic Search

The `semantic_search_codebase_tool` worked as expected:

```python
result = semantic_search_codebase_tool('qwen_workspace/sample_project', 'web server API')
# Output: Found 5 semantically similar code snippets.
# Top results pointed to `web_api.py` and `README.md`, which is logical.
```

**Insight:** Semantic search is powerful for finding conceptually related code, even if not explicitly mentioned in the text.

## 4. General Observations and Insights

1.  **Tool Usability:** The tools are generally accessible and provide structured, JSON-like outputs that are easy to work with programmatically.
2.  **Error Handling:** Some tools, like `list_undocumented_functions_tool`, have bugs in their error handling (missing imports). This is valuable feedback for improving the toolset.
3.  **Effectiveness:**
    *   `analyze_codebase_improvements_tool` gives a great starting point.
    *   `find_duplicate_code_tool` is highly effective at finding exact duplicates.
    *   `semantic_search_codebase_tool` provides intuitive results.
    *   `get_dependencies_overview_tool` offers a clear dependency map.
4.  **Areas for Improvement (in the tools themselves):**
    *   Fix the `HTTPException` import issue in `list_undocumented_functions_tool`.
    *   Investigate why `get_dependencies_overview_tool` reports only 1 file analyzed.
    *   Consider refining the sensitivity of `find_duplicate_code_tool` to reduce potential false positives for less similar code blocks.

This exploration demonstrates that the CodeSage tools provide valuable insights into a codebase, covering documentation, code quality, structure, and dependencies. They are a powerful set of utilities for code analysis and understanding.
