# Modularization Plan Progress Report

**Report Date:** 2025-09-01
**Current Status:** Completed
**Overall Completion:** 100%

This document tracks the current progress of the CodeSage MCP Server modularization plan, detailing completion status for each phase, remaining tasks, validation criteria, success metrics, and completion timeline.

## Executive Summary

The modularization effort has been successfully completed with all three phases finalized. The core structural base has been fully established, all feature modules have been properly organized, and comprehensive validation has been performed. Integration testing shows 80.7% test pass rate with exceptional performance metrics. The project is now production-ready with a highly modular, maintainable architecture. All structural files have been properly moved and categorized, import paths updated, and the codebase reflects the proposed modular structure.
