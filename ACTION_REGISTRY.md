# Action Registry for CodeSage MCP Development

This file tracks actions taken, tools used, and improvements made to the CodeSage MCP project. It complements the AGENT_WORKFLOW.md by providing a persistent record of work done and lessons learned.

## Current Development Cycle

### Tools Implemented:
1. âœ… `profile_code_performance_tool` - Performance profiling (already existed)
2. âœ… `suggest_code_improvements_tool` - Code improvement suggestions (implemented)
3. âœ… `generate_unit_tests_tool` - Test generation (just implemented)
4. ðŸ”„ `security_audit_tool` - Security auditing (planned)

### Actions Taken in Current Session:
1. âœ… Reviewed AGENT_WORKFLOW.md and improvement_plan.md
2. âœ… Analyzed current codebase state using built-in tools
3. âœ… Identified priority areas for improvement
4. âœ… Verified all existing tests pass
5. âœ… Documented findings and planned next steps
6. âœ… Created ACTION_REGISTRY.md to track work
7. âœ… Implemented `generate_unit_tests_tool` with full functionality
8. âœ… Tested new tool through multiple interfaces (direct API, MCP endpoint)
9. âœ… Verified error handling and edge cases

### Tools Usage Patterns:
- `get_configuration_tool`: Checked available LLM providers
- `analyze_codebase_improvements_tool`: Got overall codebase health
- `list_undocumented_functions_tool`: Found specific undocumented functions
- `find_duplicate_code_tool`: Identified duplicate code sections
- `get_dependencies_overview_tool`: Understood codebase dependencies
- `count_lines_of_code_tool`: Measured codebase size
- `ruff`: Checked code quality issues
- `pytest`: Verified test suite health

### Key Insights:
1. All three LLM providers are configured and ready to use
2. Codebase has good test coverage (39 tests passing)
3. Main quality issues are line length and unused imports
4. Two specific functions need documentation
5. Some code duplication exists that could be refactored

### Next Actions:
1. Implement `security_audit_tool` to improve code security
2. Fix Ruff errors for better code quality
3. Add docstrings to undocumented functions
4. Refactor large files to improve maintainability
5. Consider breaking down large test files

### Tools Development Approach:
Following the AGENT_WORKFLOW.md guidelines:
1. Use existing tools to understand patterns before implementing new ones
2. Test new tools thoroughly with unit and integration tests
3. Document new tools in README and tools_reference.md
4. Maintain backward compatibility
5. Follow "Flag and Suggest" philosophy - don't auto-apply changes
