# CodeSage MCP Server Strategic Plan
*Last Updated: 2025-08-31*

## Executive Summary
[Brief summary of the document's purpose and key takeaways.]

## Definitions
[Glossary of key terms used in this document.]

## 1. Workspace Vision & Core Objective
*   To position CodeSage as a production-ready MCP server for advanced codebase analysis, emphasizing performance excellence and self-optimization.
*   To enhance Gemini's ability to complement human users and operate more effectively within the codebase.
*   To foster a collaborative environment for LLMs (Gemini, Grok, Qwen) to collectively improve code generation and analysis.

## 2. LLM Collaboration Model
*   **Gemini (Me):** Orchestrator, task breakdown, tool execution (simple tasks), workflow management, strategic planning.
*   **Grok:** Code analysis, complex code generation, problem-solving, leveraging its specific model capabilities.
*   **Qwen (if applicable):** [Define Qwen's role/capabilities if it joins the collaboration]
*   **Human User:** Vision, high-level guidance, decision-making, final review and application of changes.
*   **Communication Protocol:** All communication between LLMs flows through the human user.

## 3. Continuous Workflow Improvement Strategy
*   **Iterative Loop:** Understand -> Plan -> Implement -> Verify -> Communicate.
*   **Feedback Loops:** Integrate insights from completed tasks to refine future approaches.
*   **Principle Adherence:** Strictly follow "tools provide data, not modify" and other established principles.
*   **Efficiency Focus:** Continuously seek ways to optimize tool usage and reduce unnecessary steps.

## 4. Gemini Capability Enhancement Roadmap (MCP Tool Development)
*   **Objective:** Identify and address Gemini's current capability gaps through the development of new MCP tools.
*   **Areas for Improvement (Examples):**
    *   **Code Modeling:** Tools for building internal representations of codebase structure, relationships, and data flow.
    *   **Advanced Indexing:** More sophisticated indexing beyond basic file content (e.g., semantic indexing, dependency graphs).
    *   **Contextual Summarization:** Tools for generating highly relevant and concise summaries of complex code sections or entire modules.
    *   **Gap Identification:** Tools to automatically identify areas where my (Gemini's) understanding or capabilities are lacking.
    *   **Refactoring Assistance:** Tools to propose and validate refactoring patterns.
    *   **Performance Analysis:** Tools for deeper profiling and bottleneck identification.
*   **Development Process:** [Outline how new MCP tools will be identified, designed, implemented (by Grok/Qwen), and integrated.]

## 5. Current Strategic Initiatives
*   **Initiative 1: Standardized Docstring Format**
    *   **Objective:** Ensure all Python functions have Google-style docstrings for improved readability and tool integration.
    *   **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (95%+ compliance achieved)
*   **Initiative 2: MCP Tools Analysis and Improvement**
    *   **Objective:** Enhance the quality and reliability of existing MCP tools.
    *   **Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT PROGRESS (100+ tools implemented with comprehensive coverage)
*   **Initiative 3: FAISS Integration Fixes**
    *   **Objective:** Resolve dimension mismatch issues in indexing system.
    *   **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (Root cause identified as test mock configuration, fix verified.)
*   **Initiative 4: Test Reliability Improvement**
    *   **Objective:** Reduce test failure rate from 19.3% to <5%.
    *   **Success Metric:** Achieve <5% test failure rate.
    *   **Status:** Significant progress made with the completion of the comprehensive test suite for Gemini Compatibility Layer. Further investigation needed for remaining test failures.
*   **Initiative 5: Production Readiness Hardening**
    *   **Objective:** Leverage Docker deployment and monitoring for enterprise-grade stability.

## 6. Key Principles & Guidelines
*   **Tools Provide Data, Not Modify:** Tools generate content/insights for review; direct codebase modification is user-controlled.
*   **Transparency:** All actions and decisions should be explainable.
*   **Safety First:** Prioritize codebase integrity and stability.
*   **Iterative Progress:** Small, verifiable steps.
*   **Performance-First**: Prioritize sub-millisecond response times and 99%+ cache hit rates.
*   **Self-Optimization**: Embrace adaptive systems for continuous performance tuning.
*   **User-Centric Feedback**: Integrate user feedback for iterative improvements.
*   **Production Resilience**: Maintain 95/100 readiness score through proactive monitoring.
