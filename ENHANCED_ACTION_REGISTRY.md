# Enhanced Action Registry for Autonomous Workspace Enhancement

This registry complements the AGENT_WORKFLOW.md by providing:
1. Enhanced autonomy through proactive workspace engagement
2. Performance tracking and optimization guidance
3. Self-improvement acceleration through pattern recognition
4. Real-time adaptation based on task effectiveness

## Current Mission: Security Audit Tool Implementation
Following the improvement_plan.md, implementing the `security_audit_tool` is our next priority.

## Autonomous Enhancement Framework

### 1. Proactive Pattern Recognition
- Continuously scan for code quality issues using existing tools
- Identify recurring patterns that could benefit from new tools
- Monitor performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

### 2. Self-Improvement Acceleration
- Implement meta-tools that automatically suggest new tool ideas
- Create feedback loops that refine approaches based on success/failure
- Build knowledge base of effective patterns and anti-patterns

### 3. Performance Optimization Engine
- Track execution time of all tool operations
- Identify frequently used tool combinations
- Optimize workflows based on historical performance data

### 4. Workspace Engagement Proactivity
- Automatically run diagnostic scans during idle periods
- Proactively identify maintenance tasks (cleanup, refactoring, etc.)
- Suggest improvements based on code quality trends

## Current Status Tracking

### Tools Implemented:
1. âœ… `profile_code_performance_tool` - Performance profiling (High Priority)
2. âœ… `suggest_code_improvements_tool` - Code improvement suggestions (High Priority)
3. âœ… `generate_unit_tests_tool` - Test generation (Medium Priority)
4. âœ… `auto_document_tool` - Automated documentation (Self-initiated enhancement)
5. ðŸ”„ `security_audit_tool` - Security auditing (Next Target)

### Performance Metrics Baseline:
- Current tool count: 17 tools
- Recent test results: All 15 core tests passing
- Codebase size: ~3,700 LOC Python, ~4,500 LOC total

## Next Actions Priority Queue:

1. **Immediate**: Implement security audit tool using bandit/static analysis
2. **Short-term**: Optimize performance of semantic search operations
3. **Mid-term**: Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Long-term**: Develop advanced visualization capabilities

## Autonomous Monitoring Checklist:

### Daily Health Checks:
- [ ] Run all tests to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Check for new TODO/FIXME comments in codebase
- [ ] Monitor tool performance metrics
- [ ] Scan for potential security vulnerabilities

### Weekly Enhancement Reviews:
- [ ] Analyze tool usage patterns for optimization opportunities
- [ ] Review code quality metrics and identify improvement areas
- [ ] Assess documentation completeness and update as needed
- [ ] Plan next capability enhancement cycle

### Monthly Capability Expansion:
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive self-assessment using built-in tools
- [ ] Identify new tool opportunities based on usage patterns
- [ ] Implement and integrate new capabilities
- [ ] Measure effectiveness of recent enhancements

## Knowledge Base Building:

### Successful Patterns Documented:
1. LLM integration pattern for enhanced code analysis
2. Error handling with graceful degradation approach
3. Multi-provider redundancy for reliability
4. Template-based documentation generation

### Anti-Patterns Identified:
1. Over-engineering that increases complexity without value
2. Insufficient error handling leading to tool failures
3. Poor documentation making tools hard to understand/use

## Real-Time Adaptation Engine:

### Context-Aware Workflow Modifiers:
- For complex tasks: Enable deeper verification loops
- For routine tasks: Streamline verification to reduce latency
- For experimental features: Increase monitoring and logging

### Performance-Based Optimization:
- Frequently used tools: Cache results where appropriate
- Resource-intensive operations: Implement background processing
- User-interactive tasks: Prioritize responsiveness

This registry will evolve as I work, becoming more sophisticated and effective at guiding autonomous enhancement.
