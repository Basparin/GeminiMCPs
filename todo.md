# CodeSage MCP Server - Next Steps & TODOs
*Last Updated: 2025-08-31*

## Executive Summary
[Brief summary of the document's purpose and key takeaways.]

## Definitions
[Glossary of key terms used in this document.]

This document outlines potential next steps and areas for improvement for the CodeSage MCP Server, based on the project's strategic plan and recent development efforts. We will prioritize these items to define our immediate focus.

## Proposed Order of Implementation

*Note: Task delegation between Gemini and Grok should follow the guidelines outlined in AGENT_WORKFLOW.md.*

Based on our analysis of impact, effort, dependencies, risk, and alignment with the project vision, here is the proposed order for the next key initiatives:

1.  **Robustness of Gemini Compatibility Layer:** (Status: COMPLETED - Comprehensive test suite developed and passed.) (Delegation: Grok)
    *   **Rationale:** Ensuring seamless and reliable communication with the Gemini CLI is paramount. This layer is foundational for all interactions and hardening it against unexpected inputs or variations in client behavior will prevent frustrating user experiences and critical communication failures.
    *   **Potential Tasks:**
        *   Develop a dedicated test suite for the `GeminiCompatibilityHandler` that covers all edge cases of JSON-RPC requests and responses.
        *   Implement more defensive programming (e.g., explicit type checking, default values) in the compatibility layer.
        *   Add logging for unexpected request formats to aid in future debugging.

2.  **Comprehensive Error Handling and Reporting:** (Status: COMPLETED - Implemented with custom exceptions, structured logging, and error reporting. See detailed summary provided by Grok.) (Delegation: Grok)
    *   **Rationale:** Improving error messages, standardizing internal logging, and implementing robust reporting mechanisms are crucial for "Production Readiness Hardening" and "Transparency." This will significantly enhance our ability to debug issues, monitor the system in operation, and maintain overall stability.
    *   **Potential Tasks:**
        *   Standardize custom exception classes for different error scenarios within the MCP server.
        *   Implement centralized error logging with structured data (e.g., using `structlog` or similar).
        *   Develop a mechanism for reporting critical errors and performance anomalies to a monitoring system.

3.  **Deep Dive into Cache Optimization and Reliability:** (Delegation: Grok)
    *   **Rationale:** While the cache tests now pass, the previous issues highlighted the need for deeper validation and optimization of the `IntelligentCache`. Achieving the "Performance-First" principle of sub-millisecond response times and 99%+ cache hit rates, along with optimal memory usage, is a high-impact area for the project's core performance and self-optimization goals.
    *   **Potential Tasks:**
        *   Implement more comprehensive unit and integration tests for `IntelligentCache`'s adaptive sizing and prefetching logic.
        *   Analyze cache hit/miss patterns in a simulated production environment to identify bottlenecks.
        *   Explore alternative caching strategies or configurations for specific data types (e.g., very large embeddings).



## Other Important Concerns (To be addressed later)

The following concerns are also important and will be addressed in future iterations, once the top priorities are stable:

*   **Advanced Code Modeling and Analysis Tools:** (Gemini's Suggestion)
*   **Automated Performance Benchmarking and Regression Detection:** (Gemini's Suggestion)
*   **Standardized Workspace Organization for LLMs:** (User's Input)
*   **Modular Workspace Design & Code Formatting Policies:** (User's Input)
*   **Test-First Development & Test Suite Migration:** (User's Input)
*   **AI-Driven Code Refactoring Engine:** Implement an advanced AI system that automatically suggests and applies complex code refactorings to improve maintainability, performance, and architecture.
*   **Multi-Modal Code Understanding:** Develop capabilities to analyze code through multiple modalities (text, structure, runtime behavior) using advanced ML models for deeper insights.
*   **Distributed Code Intelligence Network:** Create a peer-to-peer network of CodeSage instances that share learning and insights across different codebases and organizations.
*   **Autonomous Code Evolution System:** Build a system that can autonomously evolve codebases over time through continuous learning and adaptation.

## Next Steps

Please review this proposed order. If you agree, I will commit these changes to `todo.md`.
