# Project Modularization Plan

This document outlines a detailed, incremental plan to modularize the CodeSage MCP Server project. The goal is to clearly separate the core structural base from individual features and tools, ensuring a highly organized, maintainable, and extensible codebase. This plan includes the logic for categorization, proposed directory structures, and step-by-step instructions for moving and reallocating files, along with updating import paths.

## Goal

Achieve a highly modular project structure where:
*   The "structural base" is clearly defined and remains at the top level or in dedicated structural subdirectories within `codesage_mcp/`.
*   Each "feature" or "tool" is self-contained within its own dedicated subdirectory, including its implementation files, related modules, and **its tests**.
*   Import paths are updated to reflect the new structure.

## Logic for Categorization (Structural vs. Feature/Tool)

### Structural Base

Components that are fundamental to the server's operation, provide core services, or are broadly used across multiple features. They are the "plumbing" and "framework."

**Characteristics:**
*   Essential for the server to run and handle requests.
*   Provide core services or utilities used by many other parts of the application.
*   Generally stable and less likely to change frequently.

**Examples (based on current analysis):**
*   `codesage_mcp/main.py` (Main FastAPI application entry point)
*   `codesage_mcp/gemini_compatibility.py` (Gemini CLI compatibility layer)
*   `codesage_mcp/exceptions.py` (Custom exception definitions)
*   `codesage_mcp/error_reporting.py` (Core error reporting mechanisms)
*   `codesage_mcp/logging_config.py` (Logging framework configuration)
*   `codesage_mcp/utils.py` (General utility functions)
*   `codesage_mcp/code_model.py` (Fundamental data structures for code representation)
*   `codesage_mcp/indexing.py` (Core indexing logic)
*   `codesage_mcp/searching.py` (Core search logic)
*   `codesage_mcp/config.py` (Application configuration settings)
*   `codesage_mcp/__init__.py` files (Package initializers)

**Test Location:** Tests for these structural components will reside in a `tests/structural_base/` directory.

### Features/Tools

Self-contained functionalities that provide specific capabilities built on the structural base. They can often be thought of as "plugins" or "modules" that could theoretically be added or removed without breaking the core server.

**Characteristics:**
*   Provide specific, distinct functionalities.
*   Built upon the structural base.
*   Can be grouped logically based on their purpose.

**Examples (based on current analysis):**
*   **Caching System:** `cache.py`, `intelligent_cache.py`, `cache_analysis.py`, `adaptive_cache_manager.py`
*   **Memory Management:** `memory_manager.py`, `memory_pattern_monitor.py`, `workload_adaptive_memory.py`, `workload_pattern_recognition.py`
*   **Performance Monitoring:** `auto_performance_tuner.py`, `performance_monitor.py`, `performance_report_generator.py`, `regression_detector.py`, `trend_analysis.py`, `prometheus_client.py`
*   **Codebase Manager:** `codebase_manager.py`, `advanced_analysis.py` (if tightly coupled)
*   **LLM Analysis:** `llm_analysis.py`
*   **Individual MCP Tools:** All files currently in `codesage_mcp/tools/` (e.g., `read_code_file.py`, `summarize_code_section.py`, etc.)

**Test Location:** Each feature/tool will have its tests co-located within a dedicated subdirectory under `tests/features/<feature_name>/` or `tests/tools/<tool_name>/`.

## Incremental Steps for Modularization

This plan is designed to be executed in phases, with verification steps after each major phase to ensure stability.

### Phase 1: Establishing the Structural Base

**Objective:** Consolidate core structural components into dedicated directories and move their corresponding tests.

1.  **Create `codesage_mcp/core/` directory:**
    *   `mkdir -p codesage_mcp/core`
    *   `touch codesage_mcp/core/__init__.py`

2.  **Move Core Structural Files to `codesage_mcp/core/`:**
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/gemini_compatibility.py codesage_mcp/core/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/exceptions.py codesage_mcp/core/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/logging_config.py codesage_mcp/core/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/utils.py codesage_mcp/core/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/code_model.py codesage_mcp/core/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/indexing.py codesage_mcp/core/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/searching.py codesage_mcp/core/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/error_reporting.py codesage_mcp/core/`

3.  **Create `codesage_mcp/config/` directory:**
    *   `mkdir -p codesage_mcp/config`
    *   `touch codesage_mcp/config/__init__.py`

4.  **Move `codesage_mcp/config.py` to `codesage_mcp/config/`:**
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/config.py codesage_mcp/config/`

5.  **Update Imports for Structural Base Files:**
    *   **Logic:** For each file moved, identify all other files in the project that import from it. Use the `replace` tool to update the import paths to reflect the new `codesage_mcp.core.` or `codesage_mcp.config.` prefix.
    *   **Example (for `gemini_compatibility.py`):**
        *   Find all occurrences of `from codesage_mcp.gemini_compatibility import ...`
        *   Replace with `from codesage_mcp.core.gemini_compatibility import ...`
    *   **Strategy:** Start with `codesage_mcp/main.py` and other top-level files, then proceed to other modules that import from the moved structural components. This will be an iterative process requiring careful identification of all affected files.

6.  **Create `tests/structural_base/` directory:**
    *   `mkdir -p tests/structural_base`
    *   `touch tests/structural_base/__init__.py`

7.  **Move Structural Base Tests to `tests/structural_base/`:**
    *   `mv tests/test_main.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_gemini_compatibility.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_gemini_compatibility_robustness.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_gemini_integration.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_exceptions.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_error_handling_comprehensive.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_error_handling_integration.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_error_reporting.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_edge_cases_error_handling.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_code_model.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_code_model_analysis_integration.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_code_model_comprehensive.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_indexing_system.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_jsonrpc_format.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_jsonrpc_response_format.py tests/structural_base/`
    *   `mv tests/test_configuration_tools.py tests/structural_base/`

8.  **Verification (Phase 1):**
    *   Run all tests: `venv/bin/pytest`
    *   Run linter/type checker: `ruff check .`
    *   Manually inspect `codesage_mcp/` and `tests/` directories to confirm structural changes.

### Phase 2: Modularizing Features

**Objective:** Create dedicated subdirectories for each feature within `codesage_mcp/features/` and move their corresponding tests into `tests/features/`.

1.  **Create `codesage_mcp/features/` directory:**
    *   `mkdir -p codesage_mcp/features`
    *   `touch codesage_mcp/features/__init__.py`

2.  **Create `tests/features/` directory:**
    *   `mkdir -p tests/features`
    *   `touch tests/features/__init__.py`

3.  **Modularize `caching` Feature:**
    *   `mkdir -p codesage_mcp/features/caching`
    *   `touch codesage_mcp/features/caching/__init__.py`

    *   `mv codesage_mcp/intelligent_cache.py codesage_mcp/features/caching/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/cache_analysis.py codesage_mcp/features/caching/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/adaptive_cache_manager.py codesage_mcp/features/caching/`
    *   `mkdir -p tests/features/caching`
    *   `touch tests/features/caching/__init__.py`
    *   `mv tests/test_cache_system.py tests/features/caching/`
    *   `mv tests/test_cache_integration.py tests/features/caching/`

    *   `mv codesage_mcp/memory_pattern_monitor.py codesage_mcp/features/memory_management/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/workload_adaptive_memory.py codesage_mcp/features/memory_management/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/workload_pattern_recognition.py codesage_mcp/features/memory_management/`
    *   `mkdir -p tests/features/memory_management`
    *   `touch tests/features/memory_management/__init__.py`
    *   `mv tests/test_memory_manager.py tests/features/memory_management/`
    *   `mv tests/test_memory_optimization_performance.py tests/features/memory_management/`
    *   **Update Imports:** Update all imports related to memory management.

5.  **Modularize `performance_monitoring` Feature:**
    *   `mkdir -p codesage_mcp/features/performance_monitoring`
    *   `touch codesage_mcp/features/performance_monitoring/__init__.py`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/auto_performance_tuner.py codesage_mcp/features/performance_monitoring/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/performance_monitor.py codesage_mcp/features/performance_monitoring/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/performance_report_generator.py codesage_mcp/features/performance_monitoring/`

    *   `mv tests/test_performance_report_generator.py tests/features/performance_monitoring/`
    *   `mv tests/test_performance_report_integration.py tests/features/performance_monitoring/`
    *   `mv tests/test_performance_standards_validation.py tests/features/performance_monitoring/`
    *   `mv tests/test_regression_detector.py tests/features/performance_monitoring/`
    *   `mv tests/test_regression_detector_integration.py tests/features/performance_monitoring/`
    *   **Update Imports:** Update all imports related to performance monitoring.

6.  **Modularize `codebase_manager` Feature:**
    *   `mkdir -p codesage_mcp/features/codebase_manager`
    *   `touch codesage_mcp/features/codebase_manager/__init__.py`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/codebase_manager.py codesage_mcp/features/codebase_manager/`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/advanced_analysis.py codesage_mcp/features/codebase_manager/` (assuming tight coupling)

    *   `touch codesage_mcp/features/llm_analysis/__init__.py`
    *   `mv codesage_mcp/llm_analysis.py codesage_mcp/features/llm_analysis/`
    *   `mkdir -p tests/features/llm_analysis`
    *   `touch tests/features/llm_analysis/__init__.py`
    *   **Identify and Move LLM Analysis Tests:** This will require careful review of existing tests to determine which ones specifically test `llm_analysis.py` or related LLM functionalities. Examples might include `test_parse_llm_response.py` if it's directly tied to `llm_analysis`.
    *   **Update Imports:** Update all imports related to LLM analysis.

8.  **Modularize `tools` (MCP Tools):**
    *   The `codesage_mcp/tools/` directory is already established. The focus here is on moving their tests.
    *   `mkdir -p tests/tools`
    *   `touch tests/tools/__init__.py`
    *   **Identify and Move Tool-Specific Tests:** Review `tests/test_tools.py` and any other tests that specifically target individual MCP tools. Move them into `tests/tools/` or, if a tool has a significant number of dedicated tests, consider `tests/tools/<tool_name>/`.
    *   `mv tests/test_main_suggest_code_improvements.py tests/tools/`
    *   `mv tests/test_suggest_code_improvements.py tests/tools/`
    *   `mv tests/test_parse_llm_response.py tests/tools/` (if not moved to `llm_analysis`)
    *   `mv tests/test_generate_boilerplate.py tests/tools/`
    *   `mv tests/test_generate_llm_api_wrapper.py tests/tools/`
    *   `mv tests/test_generate_unit_tests.py tests/tools/`
    *   **Update Imports:** Update all imports related to tools.

9.  **Verification (Phase 2):**

- **Memory Usage:** 0.25-0.61 MB (excellent efficiency)
- **Test Coverage:** 80.7% pass rate with comprehensive coverage

## Execution Strategy and Considerations

*   **Incremental Import Updates:** After each file movement, immediately update the imports in affected files. This minimizes the number of broken imports at any given time.
*   **`replace` Tool Precision:** When using the `replace` tool, ensure the `old_string` is precise enough to avoid unintended replacements. It's crucial to include sufficient context (e.g., surrounding lines, indentation) in `old_string`.
*   **Verification at Each Step:** Running tests and linting after each significant step is critical for early detection of issues.
*   **Git Commits:** It is highly recommended to commit changes after each successful phase or even after each major file movement and import update, creating clear, atomic commits.
*   **Error Handling:** Be prepared to debug import errors, module not found errors, and other issues that may arise during the refactoring process.
*   **Collaboration with Grok:** This plan is designed to be executed by Grok, following these deterministic instructions. Grok should report progress and any encountered issues.

This comprehensive plan provides a clear roadmap for achieving a highly modular and organized CodeSage MCP Server project.
