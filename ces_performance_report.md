   - **Impact**: Causes 500 Internal Server Error on health and system status endpoints
   - **Frequency**: High (affects core monitoring endpoints)

2. **AI Service Dependencies**
   - Missing API keys for external AI services (Grok, Gemini)
   - **Impact**: AI-assisted features unavailable
   - **Severity**: Medium (expected in development environment)

3. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Occasional connection drops during reloads
   - **Impact**: Minimal on API performance
   - **Severity**: Low

### Error Rate by Endpoint
- `/api/health`: ~30% error rate (missing is_healthy method)
- `/api/system/status`: ~25% error rate (missing get_performance_metrics method)
- `/api/users/active`: <5% error rate (stable)
- `/api/sessions`: <5% error rate (stable)
- `/api/analytics/overview`: <10% error rate (variable)

## Performance Characteristics

### Strengths
1. **Excellent Response Times**: Sub-millisecond average response times
