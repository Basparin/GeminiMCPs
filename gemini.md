# CodeSage MCP Development Log (gemini.md)

## 2025-08-07 - Initial Setup and Project Kick-off

### Objective
To establish the foundational project structure for the "CodeSage" MCP server, initialize version control, and create initial documentation to guide autonomous development.

### Actions Taken
- Created the `codesage_mcp` directory and core Python files (`__init__.py`, `main.py`, `tools.py`, `config.py`, `codebase_manager.py`).
- Added basic FastAPI application structure to `main.py`.
- Implemented placeholder API key handling in `config.py` using environment variables.
- Developed initial `CodebaseManager` class in `codebase_manager.py` with a basic `read_code_file` method and a placeholder for `index_codebase`.
- Defined initial MCP tools (`read_code_file_tool`, `search_codebase_tool`, `summarize_code_section_tool`, `get_file_structure_tool`, `index_codebase_tool`) in `tools.py`, linking `read_code_file_tool` to `CodebaseManager`.
- Created `requirements.txt` with `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and `python-dotenv`.
- Wrote initial `README.md` for the overall project, outlining its purpose, planned features, and setup instructions.
- Created `codesage_mcp/README.md` for internal documentation of the MCP server's architecture and implemented tools.
- Initialized Git repository and made the first commit.
- Created a `.gitignore` file.
- Updated `README.md` with instructions for running the FastAPI server and configuring the Gemini CLI.
- Modified `main.py` to implement JSON-RPC 2.0 for tool discovery, handling the `initialize` method.
- Adjusted tool definition schema in `main.py` to simplify and explicitly include `type: "function"`.
- Ensured `error: null` is omitted from JSON-RPC responses.
- Removed `ToolDefinition` Pydantic model and constructed tool dictionaries directly for precise JSON output.
- Removed `response_model=JSONRPCResponse` from `@app.post("/mcp")` to bypass potential Pydantic serialization issues.

### Current Status
- Project structure is in place.
- FastAPI server is running and responding to `initialize` JSON-RPC requests on `/mcp`.
- Server logs show correct JSON-RPC 2.0 responses with tool definitions.
- Gemini CLI still reports "Disconnected (0 tools cached)" despite correct server responses.

### Roadblock
- The Gemini CLI is not successfully processing or registering the tools, even though the server is sending what appears to be a correctly formatted JSON-RPC `initialize` response. This suggests a very strict or undocumented schema validation within the Gemini CLI itself.

### Next Steps
1.  User to ensure Gemini CLI is up to date.
2.  User to check for Gemini CLI debug/verbose logging options for more insight.
3.  User to consider reaching out to Gemini CLI support or community forums for assistance with tool discovery issues.
