# CodeSage MCP Development Log (gemini.md)

## 2025-08-07 - Initial Setup and Project Kick-off

### Objective
To establish the foundational project structure for the "CodeSage" MCP server, initialize version control, and create initial documentation to guide autonomous development.

### Actions Taken
- Created the `codesage_mcp` directory and core Python files (`__init__.py`, `main.py`, `tools.py`, `config.py`, `codebase_manager.py`).
- Added basic FastAPI application structure to `main.py`.
- Implemented placeholder API key handling in `config.py` using environment variables.
- Developed initial `CodebaseManager` class in `codebase_manager.py` with a basic `read_code_file` method and a placeholder for `index_codebase`.
- Defined initial MCP tools (`read_code_file_tool`, `search_codebase_tool`, `summarize_code_section_tool`, `get_file_structure_tool`, `index_codebase_tool`) in `tools.py`, linking `read_code_file_tool` to `CodebaseManager`.
- Created `requirements.txt` with `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and `python-dotenv`.
- Wrote initial `README.md` for the overall project, outlining its purpose, planned features, and setup instructions.
- Created `codesage_mcp/README.md` for internal documentation of the MCP server's architecture and implemented tools.

### Current Status
- Project structure is in place.
- Basic FastAPI server is ready to run (though not yet configured for MCP).
- `read_code_file` tool is functionally implemented at a basic level.
- Initial documentation is established.

### Next Steps
1.  Initialize Git repository and make the first commit.
2.  Create a `.gitignore` file.
3.  Add instructions for running the FastAPI server.
4.  Document how to configure the Gemini CLI to use this MCP server.
5.  Test the `read_code_file` tool via the Gemini CLI.
6.  Begin implementing the `index_codebase` functionality in `codebase_manager.py`.
